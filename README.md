# node-constructor
 

This is an example of using a constructor within node.js


I created a constructor allowing you to enter in volunteer event information as well as add a list on volunteers willing to attend that event.


* information is only added within the code on the main.js file. 

to run the code open up terminal and enter 'node main.js'

It will populate with information added within the main.js file.
All of the information will display as objects.
